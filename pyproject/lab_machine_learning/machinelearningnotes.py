MARKOV CHAINS

store observed transition states; compute probability of a-> b using ratio of a -> b / a->* (where * is any state)

-can use to estimate probabilty of something having happened in the context of imperfect information



-can use to 'extend' / extrapolate data with the same probabilstic profile as the training data
